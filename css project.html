        <p>Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[5] In October 2014,
            Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA;
            as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.
            The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V.
            (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari S.p.A. group,
            and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares
            on the New York Stock Exchange.[10] Through the remaining steps of the separation,
            FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be
            owned by
            Piero Ferrari.The spin-off was completed on the 3rd of January 2016.

            Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially
            in Formula One,
            where it is the oldest and most successful racing team,
            holding the most constructors' championships and having produced the highest number of drivers'
            championship wins.Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.
            Ferrari cars are built at the 165,000 square-metre (16.5-hectare) Maranello factory.
            In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance. As of 2021,
            Ferrari is the 10th-largest car manufacturer by market capitalisation, with $52.21 billion</p>

        <h1 id="resume">RESUME</h1>
        <p>Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars
            when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. Scuderia Ferrari
            (pronounced [skuderia]) literally means "Ferrari Stable" and is usually used to mean "Team Ferrari."
            Ferrari bought,prepared, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for gentleman drivers,
            functioning as the racing division of Alfa Romeo. In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team
            and Scuderia Ferrari took over as its works team
            the Scuderia received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous
            drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. In 1938, Alfa Romeo again brought its racing operation
            in-house,
            forming Alfa Corse in Milan and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department;
            thereby disbanding the Scuderia Ferrari</p>
